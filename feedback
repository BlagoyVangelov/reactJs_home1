Hi Blagoy,

Great work, I really like what you've done it is exactly what is wanted. 

Just one small remark, if you are about to use data-attribute, you could pass the data direcly to the component, something like:

<Button action={this.changeUrl} text="First image" data_id="0" />

to become

<Button action={this.changeUrl} text="First image" data_id="https://d6d2h4gfvy8t8.cloudfront.net/18474768-orig.jpg" />

This way, the order in the array won't matter. And you can clearly see which will go into which button.

Except this small remark, everything is perfect, excelent work!
